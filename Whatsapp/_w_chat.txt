Good morning.

⛔️   Yesterday I received a call from a Delhi number +91 11-26112345 and the caller identified himself as calling on behalf of Indian Emigration Department at New Delhi. 

He asked about verification of immigration matters. 
He will talk very professionally and finally asked to 12000 HKD through some money exchange for clearing the formalities 
it shows as google number for consulate.

It seems this is a scam. Be careful 

Regards

[12/7/2022, 12:07:44 AM] ~ Deepti: Her right of abode will be revoked, but she will atill have right to land. Better for her to take an earlier flight

[12/7/2022, 12:13:05 AM] ~ Kiran Punjabi Raichura: They are not making any exceptions. I have contacted them multiple times because during covid there were flight bans too. Your right of abode gets revoked if you have not returned to hk in 3years but you still have the right to land... Which means you can still live and work here.

[14/7/2022, 8:02:45 PM] ~ STAY POSITIVE IN LIFE: https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/192247/Citizens-angry-as-many-ineligible-for-Consumption-Voucher

The second phase of the Consumption Voucher Scheme will be issued on August 7. A reader of Sing Tao Daily, surnamed Wong, complained that she was told by the government she doesn’t have the eligibility to receive the vouchers.

As Wong sought to immigrate in 2011, she has withdrawn the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF). She flew back the next year and works in Hong Kong for the last ten years. She keeps paying the taxes as well as contributing to a new MPF. 

Wong is angry and annoyed after an official SMS telling her she is ineligible for the Consumption Voucher.

The government stated that if citizens have permanently left Hong Kong or are intending to leave Hong Kong, they will lose their eligibility for the consumption voucher. A spokesperson added that some may lose their eligibility if they applied to withdraw their MPF early due to permanent departure from the city.

Kindly feel free to make use of it, *if you are* having any financial issues in providing tutoring services for your kids 


*Pls kindly forward*  to any local groups/individuals , *if you are aware of anyone*, they may need free tutoring for kids in Hk
[5/8/2022, 1:07:33 PM] ~ Raghav Rao: Right knowledge and wisdom are meant to be shared, not possessed. Our  goal is to educate every child, especially those who are less privileged. Don't let parents who struggle to provide for their children's education lose hope.

Our organization provides free tutoring services to disadvantaged minorities, and has helped several children overcome barriers to education. Some of these students obtained university degrees.

We are currently accepting new students.  Please share this link with any individuals and  groups  you believe will benefit from it.
Thank You, with much appreciation.

[6/8/2022, 7:50:09 PM] ~ Senthil Kumar Sellappan: Kokum is a tropical summer fruit with a sharp tangy taste. Dried kokum fruit is often used in various traditional cuisines, mostly as a souring agent. kokum juice as a delicious and cooling summer drink, has a wonderful health benefit of easing your anxiety, calming your mind and uplifting your mood when you are feeling low.

Consuming *Sohamna Organics Kokum Squash* helps increase the level of serotonin in your body; the mood-enhancing hormone which is responsible for making you feel positive and cheerful. Kokum has antioxidant properties to combat inflammation in the body. 

Our Kokum Squash is produced from top quality kokum fruit sweetened and preserved with organic Khandsari sugar, suitable spices to enhance the taste and make it more delightful.

*Other organic Squashes avaliable with us are Jamun, Lemon Ginger and Amla*

*Available at SOHAMNA ORGANICS in Hongkong*

[23/9/2022, 9:44:00 PM] ~ Deepti: John Lee Press Conference on Cancellation of Hotel Quarantine: 

Last updated at 1620 on 9/23: 


Mr. John Lee: 

New Measures Introduced by Hong Kong Government. 

1) All arrivals at HKIA Quarantine measures will be changed to 0+3 effective Monday, Sep 26 at 0600hrs. 

2) Pre-Flight PCR will be scrapped. This has been replaced by a RAT test to be taken within 24-hours of flight departure time. There is a need for a Day 2, Day 4 and Day 6 PCR test. 

3) Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated Hong Kong Residents can return. 

4) No quota on return to Hong Kong Scheme 

------------------------------------------

0+3 Scheme: 

• Quarantine hotels will be scrapped. 

• People can return directly home or go to any hotel of his/her choice to undergo 3 day medical surveillance.

• There will be a PCR test at the airport and there is no need to wait for the result. Test and Go arrangement. 

• All passengers can use any form of public transport

• After the airport test is negative an amber code will be sent to the handphone of the passenger. 

• On day 3 after a negative PCR test a blue code will be sent to the passenger. 

• A daily rat test must be taken for the first 7 days too. 

• If positive you can quarantine at your hotel or home. If you home is not suitable, you can still choose to ask the Hong Kong Government to invite you to one of their quarantine facilities. 

------------------------------------------

Pre-Flight PCR will be scrapped:

• RAT test must be taken within 24 hours of departure time. 

• Sounds like it needs to the test needs to be uploaded to HKGOV prior to boarding. 

------------------------------------------

Unvaccinated Hong Kong Residents can return: 

• Unvaccinated or those who have not completed their vaccinations can board a plane to Hong Kong. 

• After they have landed in Hong Kong no special exemptions will be made. They will have to follow the current Hong Kong laws to get a vaccine pass like everyone else. 

The Hong Kong Government will not lie flat and they will continue to control the number of cases in the community. The Government plans to protect the elderly, children and the vulnerable. 

Hong Kong should be optimistic about controlling the epidemic. 

------------------------------------------

Professor Lo Chung-Mau: 

• Prof Lo has data that can show you why 0+3 will not increase risk compared to 0+0. 

• The one reason for 0+3 and the PCR tests is because The Hong Kong Government does not want new variants to enter the community.

• Hong Kong is following a science based approach 

• He thanks all those involved including the general public in taking vaccinations this year. The number of those fully vaccinated persons have greatly increased compared to earlier this year. 

• The young and old need extra protection. 

• The R value is currently less than 1 and community testing centers are seeing a downward trend. 

• Professor Lo believes the Omicron Ba. 5 spread is under control

• Starting 8/22 (3+4 Introduction Date) visitor numbers have increased. 

• About 3.3% of inbound visitors are positive compared to the earlier 4.7%

• Global figures are falling. 

• Law enforcement have not found any amber code persons trying to enter restricted premises. 

------------------------------------------

Mr. John Lee: 

• He wants to control the overall epidemic situation in an orderly way. 

• The Government will monitor the situation closely, so all the risks are controlled and things can progress in an orderly manner. 

• If there are positive developments as we progress, there will be more room for more activities to open up. 

• Visitors will come as we are a free economy, a place of opportunities, a place of east meets west, a place of success stories and a place where you can use HK to open a base to The Mainland. 

• After the 3rd day you can do everything a Hong Kong Citizen does including eat and drink out.

*NO MORE PARTICULAR DAY*


Pls Read below - if you have skipped last 10 /more postings












 *MAJOR CHANGES TO REAL ESTATE AND BUSINESS ADVERTISING* 

Effective from 1st September 2022, all business and real estate advertisers must make a *minimum deposit of HKD50 to a CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION registered UNDER section 88, Inland Revenue Department Cap. 112* in order to post their advertisement in the Help Group.

Please note that *NO money should be transferred to any of the admins* nor do the admins gain any financial incentive from this plan of action.  This step is just in line with the long-term endeavor of the Help Group to continually extend helping hands to people in need. 

Posting details: 

•	All forms of advertising (Rent /Sell residential /commercial property or promote your products/service / any commercial activity and second hand sales) can be done ONLY upon making a charitable donation of HKD50 (minimum value per donation). It cannot be posted directly by you /others except ADMINS.

•	Only one photo with or without a short message containing contact information is allowed. No videos, pdfs, documents allowed. 

•	Minimum HKD50 to be paid to the charitable organization for each advertisement (ONETIME PAYMENT = ONETIME ADVERTISEMENT PERMITTED).

•	One-time donations made of a larger value (greater than HKD50) cannot be used for multiple advertisement postings. The admins do not have the scope to keep a record of the pending amount in the donations made with the number of advertisements posted. (ONETIME PAYMENT of HKD50 or more = ONETIME ADVERTISEMENT PERMITTED).

[6/10/2022, 1:07:12 PM] ~ Anandhakannan: You no more need to go to the post office to update your vaccination records in LHS,.. It can be done online. It was done for me online without going to the PO
[6/10/2022, 1:08:05 PM] ~ Rashmi: I tried online. The code generated by the online form is considered invalid by LHS
[6/10/2022, 1:08:17 PM] ~ Rashmi: It does not recognize the code
[6/10/2022, 1:10:30 PM] ~ Rashmi: Maybe I'll try again today. I tried to scan on LHS right after registration, perhaps needs some time? Also what was the doc number you entered on the online regn? I had to enter my mom's adhar card number as that's is the doc on the vaccination record. Does that make a difference, I wonder🤔
[6/10/2022, 2:03:51 PM] ~ Priyaraj: The vaccination certificate should have passport number..

[7/10/2022, 11:46:11 AM] ~ Deepti: John Lee Press Conference on Cancellation of Hotel Quarantine: 

Last updated at 1620 on 9/23: 


Mr. John Lee: 

New Measures Introduced by Hong Kong Government. 

1) All arrivals at HKIA Quarantine measures will be changed to 0+3 effective Monday, Sep 26 at 0600hrs. 

2) Pre-Flight PCR will be scrapped. This has been replaced by a RAT test to be taken within 24-hours of flight departure time. There is a need for a Day 2, Day 4 and Day 6 PCR test. 

3) Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated Hong Kong Residents can return. 

4) No quota on return to Hong Kong Scheme 

------------------------------------------

0+3 Scheme: 

• Quarantine hotels will be scrapped. 

• People can return directly home or go to any hotel of his/her choice to undergo 3 day medical surveillance.

• There will be a PCR test at the airport and there is no need to wait for the result. Test and Go arrangement. 

• All passengers can use any form of public transport

• After the airport test is negative an amber code will be sent to the handphone of the passenger. 

• On day 3 after a negative PCR test a blue code will be sent to the passenger. 

• A daily rat test must be taken for the first 7 days too. 

• If positive you can quarantine at your hotel or home. If you home is not suitable, you can still choose to ask the Hong Kong Government to invite you to one of their quarantine facilities. 

------------------------------------------

Pre-Flight PCR will be scrapped:

• RAT test must be taken within 24 hours of departure time. 

• Sounds like it needs to the test needs to be uploaded to HKGOV prior to boarding. 

------------------------------------------

Unvaccinated Hong Kong Residents can return: 

• Unvaccinated or those who have not completed their vaccinations can board a plane to Hong Kong. 

• After they have landed in Hong Kong no special exemptions will be made. They will have to follow the current Hong Kong laws to get a vaccine pass like everyone else. 

The Hong Kong Government will not lie flat and they will continue to control the number of cases in the community. The Government plans to protect the elderly, children and the vulnerable. 

Hong Kong should be optimistic about controlling the epidemic. 

------------------------------------------

Professor Lo Chung-Mau: 

• Prof Lo has data that can show you why 0+3 will not increase risk compared to 0+0. 

• The one reason for 0+3 and the PCR tests is because The Hong Kong Government does not want new variants to enter the community.

• Hong Kong is following a science based approach 

• He thanks all those involved including the general public in taking vaccinations this year. The number of those fully vaccinated persons have greatly increased compared to earlier this year. 

• The young and old need extra protection. 

• The R value is currently less than 1 and community testing centers are seeing a downward trend. 

• Professor Lo believes the Omicron Ba. 5 spread is under control

• Starting 8/22 (3+4 Introduction Date) visitor numbers have increased. 

• About 3.3% of inbound visitors are positive compared to the earlier 4.7%

• Global figures are falling. 

• Law enforcement have not found any amber code persons trying to enter restricted premises. 

------------------------------------------

Mr. John Lee: 

• He wants to control the overall epidemic situation in an orderly way. 

• The Government will monitor the situation closely, so all the risks are controlled and things can progress in an orderly manner. 

• If there are positive developments as we progress, there will be more room for more activities to open up. 

• Visitors will come as we are a free economy, a place of opportunities, a place of east meets west, a place of success stories and a place where you can use HK to open a base to The Mainland. 

• After the 3rd day you can do everything a Hong Kong Citizen does including eat and drink out.

[10/10/2022, 10:47:34 PM] ~ Panna Modi: Employment visa

[12/10/2022, 4:48:57 PM] ~ Nishant Shah: hi - I have a specific query which Immigration dept didnt give me a proper reply about despite emailing twice. 
if anyone has knowledge about this, can you please guide me.

I have resigned from my old job in HK and will be starting a new one in 3months. In the interim, I have returned to India. 
now after resignation, my right to work stands revoked, but I still have right of abode. Does this mean I can travel to HK until I have a valid right of abode even before starting my new job/obtaining new employment visa with new employer?
[12/10/2022, 4:49:29 PM] ~ Nishant Shah: Re-entry into the HKSAR

Non-permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), irrespective of their nationality and type of travel document held, do not require a re-entry visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR provided that they return within the currency of their permitted limit of stay and that the circumstances upon which they have acquired their residential status remain unchanged.

above is from immd website
https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/GEP.html#lastTab
[12/10/2022, 5:03:13 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: From my understanding, if your employment visa is sponsored by your employer, and you leave the employer, the visa sponsored by them stands cancelled. You have 1 month to find a new sponsor or leave. I guess in your case, you need new visa sponsored by your new company to come back again.
[12/10/2022, 5:04:43 PM] ~ Nishant Shah: no, that much im clear about and have confirmed with immd, that I have a right of abode until the end of expiry of employment visa. 
when i leave my employer, only my right to work ceases, not my right of abode.
[12/10/2022, 5:06:59 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: But right to abode is only for permanent residents
[12/10/2022, 5:07:08 PM] ~ Nishant Shah: no
[12/10/2022, 5:08:49 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: It is as per immigration website.
[12/10/2022, 5:09:52 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/roa/eligible.html
[12/10/2022, 5:10:28 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: You need to be ordinary resident of hk for continuous 7 years to get this status
[12/10/2022, 5:10:35 PM] ~ Nishant Shah: I have an email from my old employer and immd confirming I have right of abode until expiry of my old employment visa. 
this is not something im worried about.
[12/10/2022, 5:10:49 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Ok
[12/10/2022, 5:13:41 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: If immd has confirmed that you have right of abode that means you can enter hk anytime till ur current visa is valid
[12/10/2022, 5:16:39 PM] ~ Nishant Shah: "that means you can enter hk anytime till ur current visa is valid" <-- this is the part i'm trying to understand because neither their website nor their email confirms anything to this effect
[12/10/2022, 5:17:04 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Right of abode means entering Hong Kong without restriction
[12/10/2022, 5:17:24 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: If immd has confirmed you have right of abode, that means you can enter
[12/10/2022, 5:19:18 PM] ~ Nishant Shah: acha

They are asking among local Chinese, but I call out to u so more ethnicities here could participate ...

[6/11/2022, 1:05:14 PM] ~ Rathnam: Hi can any one help 
my contract is 2 years one is fixed and one years optional. So I was move in 1st Nov,2021 . After 12 month and paying 13 th month rent, today I gave one month notice to landlord that I move out by December 5,2022 due to some infrastructure related issues in the flat. But landlord says only I should inform before 12 month finished not now. So landlord says , the second year contract inforced now and can't be vacated until next Oct 23.

Can any one help how to deal such scenarios
‎[6/11/2022, 1:05:29 PM] ~ Rathnam: ‎<attached: 00002112-PHOTO-2022-11-06-13-05-31.jpg>
[6/11/2022, 1:06:37 PM] ~ Rathnam: This is agreement clause 👆
[6/11/2022, 1:07:22 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Your landlord is wrong. You can leave anytime after 12 month period is over by giving notice of one month
[6/11/2022, 1:07:22 PM] ~ Kumar: You can vacate the flat but it will be breaking the lease contract and you may loose the deposit accordingly
[6/11/2022, 1:07:52 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: It's not lease break if vacsting after 12 month
[6/11/2022, 1:08:19 PM] ~ Rathnam: So I don't need to loose my 2 months, isn't it?
[6/11/2022, 1:09:13 PM] ~ Rathnam: I was trying to explain but he is not even listening and explain his version of understanding
So someone can help how to deal these kind of issues

[6/11/2022, 1:10:33 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Is landlord local? If yes, suggest find a Cantonese speaker you trust who can explain it to your landlord

[6/11/2022, 1:13:26 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Your landlord is clearly straying away from what is being written on the agreement
[6/11/2022, 1:14:23 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Your agreement clearly mention tenant can leave anytime after 12 month of stay, by giving one month of notice

inform him about the house infrastructure problem you are facing at your current home you are rented mention all detail problems and so you want to move out

If even after that he is not listening,  You can file the Legal case submitting your Tennant agreement Copy and Copy of your written letter and proof that you have also sent him the letter which should be acknowledged by post office chop of your registered letter and also keep the Post office payment receipt ( Do make Xerox also of this receipt and submit to the court also along with your filed court case documents)

Court document filing case is very nominal

There will no lawyers for any parties 
As both you and your land lord have to defend the case on your own

If you need my help
You may contact me for further assistance 

Good luck 👍 my friend

[11/11/2022, 9:23:50 AM] ~ Angel 🦖: 1. What is clause 18 ? 
There’s is a condition here saying if the landlord has not exercised clause 18 on you only then you can terminate the lease. 
2. As someone said earlier on this chat, you should go by the books. The termination clause is dependant on “Effective Date” of the contract. 
If the contract became effective on 25 oct 2021, then your 12 months finish on 25th oct 2022. Any time after that you can just give written notice 1 month in advance and then vacate. You can take him to the tenancy dept.

*Attention Mumbai Flat Owners, No NOC Needed From Housing Society To Sell/Rent Flats Now*  - Minister Shares BIG Update
Maharashtra Housing 

Minister Dr Jitendra Awhad said that as per the by-laws, the society's permissions are not required for owners to either sell/hire out their homes, yet many managing committees are insisting on their clearance – Mumbai - 

In a big news for Mumbai flat owners, Maharashtra Housing Minister Dr Jitendra Awhad on Tuesday announced that from now on - no prior permission or no objection certificate (NOC) from a cooperative housing society would be necessary for owners wanting to sell/rent out their flats. 

This would enable the owners to conduct his/her rental/sale transactions without hassles or delays and prevent harassment by the society committees to green signal such proposals, the minister said - 

“We have come to know that many housing societies discriminate on the basis of caste, creed, religion, community, vegetarians and don’t permit the owners to sell/rent out their properties,” Dr Awhad said. 

He pointed out how in some societies or localities dominated by any particular community, certain communities are barred in the name of preferring only ‘vegetarians’, or preventing Dalits and Other Backward Classes, which is leading to increasing hatred among the people - 

He said as per the by-laws, the society’s permissions are not required for owners to either sell/hire out their homes, yet many managing committees are insisting on their clearance. 

“Now, if the owner wishes to sell-rent out his flat, he/she will not need the society’s NOC,”  

Dr Awhad declared, justifying it on grounds of Mumbai being a leading cosmopolitan city in the world and such tactics were sullying the image of the country’s financial capital.

Decision welcomed by many - Several individuals, societies, and the Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association have approved and welcomed Dr Awhad’s initiative, and urged that it should be formalised through a ‘Government Resolution’ with punitive clauses for the errant societies/managing committee members.

- There have been many instances in the past when people, including many celebs, were barred from buying/selling flats in certain areas/housing societies under the garb of the NOC,  but now that will stop, said a Kandivali CHS Chairman, preferring anonymity. 

“Consequently, many lose out on a potentially lucrative deal, their transactions get delayed in the societal red-tapism, some societies even demand a certain amount of the deal as a ‘donation’ to the building funds, and there was harassment of both the buyers and the sellers on various counts,” he said.

Then asks for full payment initially but settles for 20% payment before delivery and balance in cash on delivery.  Once the initial 20% payment is made to his bank account, the fraudster blocks the buyer on whatsapp and disappears.

People who regularly run or engage in other aerobic exercise cut their chance of developing some cancers by 72 percent, according to research from Tel Aviv University.

Aerobic exercise makes some organs so efficient at grabbing sugar that is in the body that tumors are left starved of glucose, and often unable to grow and spread, the peer-reviewed study published last week suggested.

It focused on metastatic cancer, meaning cancer that has spread from its original location in the body. Researchers believe there are also strong benefits in preventing primary tumors, but focused on metastatic cancer as it is Israel’s leading cause of death.


“Physical activity is creating a hostile setting for tumors by creating an environment where it has difficulty obtaining glucose,” lead author Prof. Carmit Levy, from the Tel Aviv University’s Department of Human Genetics and Biochemistry, told The Times of Israel.

“We showed in this study that running and other aerobic activity protects the body from metastatic activity, and discovered what mechanism makes this happen.”

*PART TIME WORK SCAM*
*CRYPTO SCAM*
*MANY MORE*

One of my friend working in lawyers office told me yesterday one indian came to their office saying he has lost *HKD2,000,000*

While discussing other person said someone lost *INR 30,00,000* by borrowing money by lodging his property 

One person from help group 1 said his friend lost *HKD600,000*

I am really confused how people can give money and fall in these scams

We have discussed this earlier but this needs more awakening, never pay money to get part time work and they pull you inside until you lose big money by tempting you

*NEVER SPARE A PENNY* to any stranger.
Don’t get excited , too many scams around on social media

Hope we won’t hear anymore, we need to educate our friends/relatives.

Very happy to know that few people saved their money from THOSE CHEATING GANGS and hope more and more becomes aware , so I am going to post this msg continuously as many of our friends don’t scroll old msg - pls forward to all groups -

One tip in IT / part time job is the person gives you a task and asks u to deposit a small amount , don’t get into it

Some sends invite code for u to participate 

These are what I learnt from our friends

Be aware of asking for your *CREDIT CARD*  one of my friend told me someone posing like a Marriott staff offered some nice packages and he stopped as she had all his details except his email ID, and luckily escaped from giving his credit card , even though they ask u for small, they will charge big amount. 

Hope we won’t hear anymore, we need to educate our friends/relatives.


Please spread this to ALL YOUR FRIENDS , HK, India , everywhere….

[13/12/2022, 8:20:07 AM] ~ Raghav Rao: Just ask BLS to fill form , however you do it right , they are going to find fault as they make sure everyone pays for filling the form.
[13/12/2022, 8:22:29 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: It's not about filling form. The last time I asked then about bifurcation of my name, they asked me to fill an affidavit in india saying I am changing my name. This is ridiculous as I hadn't changed my name. I just want to seperate my given and surname. So I want to know from someone who has gone through the same issue and how it is resolved. Both bls and Indian consulate have been very unhelpful in this regard

*HOTEL / FLIGHT BOOKING SCAM*
*PART TIME WORK SCAM*
*CRYPTO SCAM*
*MANY MORE*

Very happy to know that few people saved their money from THOSE CHEATING GANGS and hope more and more becomes aware , so I am going to post this msg continuously as many of our friends don’t scroll old msg - pls forward to all groups -

One tip in IT / part time job is the person gives you a task and asks u to deposit a small amount , don’t get into it

Some sends invite code for u to participate 

These are what I learnt from our friends 

———————
One of my friend working in lawyers office told me yesterday one indian came to their office saying he has lost *HKD2,000,000*

While discussing other person said someone lost *INR 30,00,000* by borrowing money by lodging his property 

One person from help group 1 said his friend lost *HKD600,000*

I am really confused how people can give money and fall in these scams

We have discussed this earlier but this needs more awakening, never pay money to get part time work and they pull you inside until you lose big money by tempting you

*NEVER SPARE A PENNY* to any stranger.
Don’t get excited , too many scams around on social media

Be aware of asking for your *CREDIT CARD*  one of my friend told me someone posing like a Marriott staff offered some nice packages and he stopped as she had all his details except his email ID, and luckily escaped from giving his credit card , even though they ask u for small, they will charge big amount.

[20/12/2022, 1:20:45 PM] ~ Kulbir Don Singh: Below is a piece I wrote about my turning to veganism. It won 2nd prize in the poem category of the Jasmina Awards 2022 (a writing competition for seniors). Please feel free to share with anyone who may relate with it.
[20/12/2022, 1:20:46 PM] ~ Kulbir Don Singh: *A CHANGE IN LATER LIFE*

In my 60s, and still going strong
Made a change hoping nothing would go wrong
Learning of animal cruelty, animal oppression
I decided to embrace the life of a vegan

The thought I reflected on
Which kept coming round
_‘Should my existence be hovering,_
_On the back of another’s suffering’_ 

The slaughter of animals seemed in vain
I began to contemplate their pain
If not wanting the killing to prolong
Is veganism where I belong?

Denying animals moral consideration
Felt like a form of discrimination
Killing another 'species'
Could this be a moral disease?

Seeing animals as either food or pet
We eat one, the other we pat
Seeing a dying chicken, a dying cat
But could only save one, how would I act?

There are places they eat dogs and cats
Which pains us who think them pets
But let our thoughts a minute quicken
What’s the difference between cat and chicken?

Due to culture, due to convenience
Less aware and with little lenience
We eat the flesh and secretions of animals
Compulsions present like life-long manacles

Factory farms caging poultry and mammals
Millions confined like creature criminals
Swine, poultry and cattle raised solely
For taste buds to say 'the meat tastes lovely'

The food industry converts animal bodies 
Into cheap food for modern societies 
Meat in a van, meat in a can
From boxes and shelves, straight to a pan

To avoid doing the killing ourselves
To avoid the blood, the noise, the smells
The slaughter happens far from dwellings and mansions
And even further from our thoughts and conscience

Dairy cows are artificially inseminated
To induce milk much awaited
Their babies wrenched away at birth
An experience like hell on earth	

Male calves are killed for veal
Widely considered a high-end meal
Females raised till their 'teens'
To replace their mums as milk machines

In a few years udders exhausted
Mothers to the slaughter house escorted
In a state of utmost grief
Killed, processed into cuts of beef

But animals are sentient beings
Having thoughts, emotions, and feelings
We see this in which we declare a pet
But not in those our appetite whet

Facing death whether pig or sheep
Will run, scream, resist or weep
A sign of life’s longing for itself
For no being willingly gives up its self

But humans in a natural state
Empathise, love, care and relate
With all beings regardless whether
They walk, fly, crawl or slither

Thus, most cringe and look-away
At the sight of a life taken-away
So, we outsource the killing
To abattoirs since we’re unwilling

Changing from 'lovely the meat I ate'
To being animal compassionate
Needed understanding and information
And lots of heartfelt inspiration

Rejecting meat curry
Which I used to eat in a hurry
For family to understand was difficult
They still look upon befuddled

Chicken, prawn, crab and fish,
Which I used to crave and wish
Do not appeal anymore
So now I easily ignore

Foods I eat now
Since I took this vow
Veggies, fruit, lentils, beans
Grains, nuts, seeds and greens

Eating only a plant cuisine
Some wonder if I lack protein
But look at the elephant, strong and big
Eats only grass, leaf and twig

Rejecting human exceptionalism
I now see all through an empathy prism
To have compassion for all in need
For human, or animal of any breed

But all said all done
My views are personal ones
To myself are they directed
As my inner voice and I stay connected

I can only be the change I want to see
And not compel others to agree
But with optimism and hope I foresee
The day will come when _all beings are set free_

Unfortunately, I will be leaving back to my country end of January and will not be returning to HK anytime soon. The membership transferred is up to end of March with 8 personal training sessions. It would be helpful if you could contact me directly if you’re interested and I will provide further details. Kindly circulate this message if possible.

[28/12/2022, 5:06:02 PM] ~ Deepti: Dec 28 -Anti-epidemic Command and Coordination Group Press Conference hosted by Chief Executive, Mr. John Lee. 

Relaxation of Epidemic Measures: 

Effective at 0001hrs on December 29th, 2022. 

1.	Cancellation of Quarantine orders. The Govenment will no  longer going trace close contacts. Hong Kong Government will continue to give assistance and advice to those who test positive. 

2.	Cancellation of Vaccine Pass. The Hong Kong Government will continue to push for high vaccination rates within the community. 

3.	Cancellation of All PCR Testing. The cancellation will mean arrivals from everywhere including outside of Mainland China will no longer be required to test. Travelers will continue to be required to take a RAT test daily for 5 days after arriving in Hong Kong. 

4.	Cancellation of All Social Distancing Measures. 

5.	Masks mandate will remain. 



The Government has come to this conclusion after considering the following: 



1.	The very high vaccination rate of the population

2.	Over 2.5 million people have been previously infected with Covid 19

3.	Hong Kong has a sufficient supply of effective medications to treat Covid-19. 

4.	Health personnel understand how to deal with Covid-19 after three years of experience. 

5.	The Hospital Authority capacity to deal with Covid-19 has been greatly improved. 

6.	With 3 years of experience, Hong Kong people have a very good understanding and well equipped to protect themselves from Covid-19. 

7.	Anti-Epidemic Measures will focus on protecting high risk groups. These include those who live in elderly homes as well as the old and the young. 



These measures are to help Hong Kong return to normalcy. 



Professor Lo Chung-mau - Secretary of Health:



•	The Government has been taking gradual steps to resume normalcy in Hong Kong. 



Quarantine Order and Close Contacts: 

1.	There will be no more defined close contacts and quarantine orders. We have been fighting the Covid-19 virus for three years and we have a high vaccination rate, an increasing level of immunity barrier within the community. The capacity to tackle the epidemic challenges has been enhanced. Family members of positive cases of confirmed cases and other closes contacts will not be placed under testing or quarantine arrangements. Department of Health will issue advice to positive cases as well as to their family members. 

2.	Quarantine orders will be stopped as of tomorrow and those in quarantine facilities will be released tomorrow. 

3.	Isolation arrangements for positive cases will remain the same. The Government will closely monitor the epidemic and will adjust the measures when necessary. 

4.	Government will no longer send out anti epidemic kits to close contacts. Confirmed cases will continue to receive anti epidemic kits. 



Vaccine Pass:

The Government has decided to cancel the vaccine pass system under Cap 599L. 

1.	Since the introduction, it has been effective and it has successfully raised the vaccination rate to a high level. 

2.	83% of residents in Hong Kong have had at least three doses.

3.	The Government will look for more targeted measures to the elderly and the young. 



Testing for inbound travelers: 

ALL PCR Testing has been cancelled. 

1.	Taking into account to resume the flow of people from Mainland and Hong Kong. 

2.	Hong Kong will streamline the rules to All travelers including those from Mainland China. 

3.	All Inbound travelers must do a RAT test 24 prior to departure of a PCR test no more than 48 hours prior to departure. 

4.	Health Declaration form will be cancelled however if the inbound traveler still wants to electronically submit one then he/she is free to do so. 

5.	A photograph copy of the travelers RAT or PCR result should be kept in case a health officer asks for proof during an inspection.

6.	Health advice will be issued to all arriving passengers. 

7.	A Rat test is required from Day 1-5 upon arrival. 



Social Distancing Measures: 

1.	All social distancing measures have been cancelled. 

2.	All measures under Cap 599F and Cap 599G will be removed.

3.	Mask mandate remains under Cap 599I. Mask wearing can protect yourself and those around you. Hong Kong is now in a high flu season. Experts believe that getting rid of the mask mandate will cause a lot of disease and The Government must protect the healthcare system. 



Arrangement of Local Medical Resources: 

1.	Local people will have priority in the healthcare system. 

2.	Hospital Authority (HA) has been enhancing its capacity.

3.	HA will continue ask private healthcare to support them. 

4.	Paxlovid and other drugs have been given to private clinics and hospitals. This can help lessen the burden on the public system

5.	HA will provide services and drugs to local residents. Tourists and non residents cannot use designated clinics. Non eligible persons will also provide treatment to urgent treatments and those will be charged a higher rate. 

6.	HA will keep a good supply of pain and fever medicine like paracetamol. Department of Health will make sure there is sufficient stock. 

7.	Private sector can now order the two types of covid medicines from the manufacturers. Those who are not Hong Kong residents will need to pay $6000. 

8.	The objective and policy is to make sure there is always a sufficient supply of vaccinations for Hong Kong Residents. 

9.	Government will not offer Government procured vaccines to non Hong Kong residents. Private sector may do so. 



Summary: 

1.	Covid transmission is still high if you look at the waste water samples. 

2.	Covid together with Flu will put pressure on the healthcare system. The old and young needs to be protected. 

3.	Sewage surveillance program will continue. 

4.	Random tests for genome sequencing will be carried out from testing centers to look for variants of concern. 

5.	Everyone needs to work together. 

•	Get vaccinated 

•	Wear your mask 

•	Protect high risk groups.

*PART TIME WORK SCAM*
*CRYPTO SCAM*
*MANY MORE*

Very happy to know that few people saved their money from THOSE CHEATING GANGS and hope more and more becomes aware , so I am going to post this msg continuously as many of our friends don’t scroll old msg - pls forward to all groups -

One tip in IT / part time job is the person gives you a task and asks u to deposit a small amount , don’t get into it

Some sends invite code for u to participate 

These are what I learnt from our friends 

———————
One of my friend working in lawyers office told me yesterday one indian came to their office saying he has lost *HKD2,000,000*

While discussing other person said someone lost *INR 30,00,000* by borrowing money by lodging his property 

One person from help group 1 said his friend lost *HKD600,000*

I am really confused how people can give money and fall in these scams

We have discussed this earlier but this needs more awakening, never pay money to get part time work and they pull you inside until you lose big money by tempting you

*NEVER SPARE A PENNY* to any stranger.
Don’t get excited , too many scams around on social media

Be aware of asking for your *CREDIT CARD*  one of my friend told me someone posing like a Marriott staff offered some nice packages and he stopped as she had all his details except his email ID, and luckily escaped from giving his credit card , even though they ask u for small, they will charge big amount. 

Hope we won’t hear anymore, we need to educate our friends/relatives.


Please spread this to ALL YOUR FRIENDS , HK, India , everywhere….

Thanks

How convenient/difficult it is for an unvaccinated non-HK individual to enter Hong Kong? (unvaccinated due to certain health conditions)

Although the Govt website clearly mentions that the inbound travellers should "fulfil vaccination requirements", and exempts people unvaccinated due to health conditions but i want to know if someone actually went through this procedure and how it went?

Now we got final bill as 51k. When I enquired they said the one we were getting was estimated and this is the actual bill.
I am in hk for more than 9 yrs and lives in many flats but never encountered such thing.
Any help/ suggestion would be much appreciated. Thank you

[10/1/2023, 9:14:50 PM] ~ Panna Modi: No. I have not. As I was thinking the bill coming is actual one as the bill was not flat throughout
[10/1/2023, 9:26:58 PM] ~ Bhavishya Panjabi: Hi. Did u make sure that the old tenant cleared all the payments before u started and restarted the billing under ur new name..This is very important when we move into new house.. rented or owned.. all the bills should be started with zero under our ID names. Usually agents do this

Very happy to know that few people saved their money from THOSE CHEATING GANGS and hope more and more becomes aware , so I am going to post this msg continuously as many of our friends don’t scroll old msg - pls forward to all groups -

One tip in IT / part time job is the person gives you a task and asks u to deposit a small amount , don’t get into it

Some sends invite code for u to participate 

These are what I learnt from our friends 

———————
One of my friend working in lawyers office told me yesterday one indian came to their office saying he has lost *HKD2,000,000*

While discussing other person said someone lost *INR 30,00,000* by borrowing money by lodging his property 

One person from help group 1 said his friend lost *HKD600,000*

I am really confused how people can give money and fall in these scams

We have discussed this earlier but this needs more awakening, never pay money to get part time work and they pull you inside until you lose big money by tempting you

*NEVER SPARE A PENNY* to any stranger.
Don’t get excited , too many scams around on social media

Be aware of asking for your *CREDIT CARD*  one of my friend told me someone posing like a Marriott staff offered some nice packages and he stopped as she had all his details except his email ID, and luckily escaped from giving his credit card , even though they ask u for small, they will charge big amount. 

Hope we won’t hear anymore, we need to educate our friends/relatives.

[20/1/2023, 4:20:25 PM] ~ Karen Purswaney HK: I am NRI

And I am told NRI can only have PAN cards, cannot have adhar card.

[20/1/2023, 4:22:05 PM] ~ Siva: Can an NRI apply for Aadhaar?
YES. An NRI (whether minor or adult) with a valid Indian Passport can apply for Aadhaar from any Aadhaar Kendra.
[20/1/2023, 4:22:24 PM] ~ Siva: Above in government website uidai.gov.in
[20/1/2023, 4:23:20 PM] ~ Siva: They need a local address proof and can done at any post office and they take a IRIS scan and fingerprinting just takes a day to finish and collection can be done at postal address by a representative
[20/1/2023, 4:26:21 PM] ~ Siva: What is the process for Aadhaar enrolment for children of NRIs?keyboard_arrow_up
Pls refer to the below:

Child is below 5 years of age:

One of the parents/ guardian has to authenticate on behalf of the child and also give consent for enrolment of the minor by signing the enrolment form.
If the child is an NRI - valid Indian passport of the child is mandatory as Proof of Identity (PoI)
If the child is an Indian resident (not NRI) - any valid Proof of Relationship document (refer: https://uidai.gov.in/images/commdoc/valid_documents_list.pdf) such as Birth Certificate, along with Aadhaar of the parent/ guardian, can be used for enrolment.
Child is between 5 to 18 years of age:

One of the parents/ guardian has to give consent for enrolment of the minor by signing the enrolment form.
If the minor is an NRI – valid Indian passport of the child is mandatory as Proof of Identity (PoI)
If the minor is an Indian resident (not NRI) -
No document in the name of the minor: any valid Proof of Relationship document (refer: https://uidai.gov.in/images/commdoc/valid_documents_list.pdf) such as Birth certificate can be used for enrolment under Head of Family.
Minor has a document: use a valid Proof of Identity (PoI) and Proof of Address (PoA) document (like School ID card) in the child’s name for enrolment (refer: https://uidai.gov.in/images/commdoc/valid_documents_list.pdf).

KP: Hi 
I hope you all are doing well 
I wanted a small help 
I wanted to know where can I do  attestation or true copy for Aadhar Card , Passport and Visa Copy etc 
I have tried to get appointment on BLS but isn’t available as we are tight  on the schedule, apparently my parents are flying back on 31st January
Kindly acknowledge us further 
Thanks in advance
[20/1/2023, 6:29:36 PM] ~ Vaibhav: NRIs, although they are citizens of India, are not eligible for Aadhaar Card if they have not stayed for more than 182 days or more in the last 12 months.  Upon completion of 182 days of their stay in India in the last 12 months immediately preceding the date of application for enrolment, NRIs can apply for Aadhaar Card.
[20/1/2023, 6:30:13 PM] ~ Vaibhav: Aadhaar Card is meant for "residents" in India.

[20/1/2023, 9:21:51 PM] ~ Karen Purswaney HK: I was told NRI’s shud NOT have a adhar card. Only pan card. So I have been believing that.
[20/1/2023, 9:30:44 PM] ~ RR: I got Aadhar card when I was NRI, although later I came to know it was only for resident only. Sometimes to avail some services you need Aadhar card! PAN card is compulsory for Indian citizens for filling IT returns. I am also aware that PAN card and Aadhar card needs to be linked compulsorily and this year is last year to do so with penalty. Someone authoritative needs to confirm how it will be treated for NRIs?
[20/1/2023, 9:34:28 PM] ~ RR: It's very interesting that political parties will somehow get Aadhar card for Rohingya M's even if they are illegal immigrants. Sorry cannot be of much help.

[20/1/2023, 9:35:56 PM] ~ Kshitij Shah: Yes there is. Got mine through Tatkal in 2018. The service center here isn't the most efficiently managed so need to be a bit pushy to get them to tell you what kind of form you need to submit etc. This was my experience in 2018 at least. Hope they have improved now.

It takes 9 long months of rigours and mental and physical pain to bring a living human being into this world to face the complexities of the daily life but it just takes 9 minutes for these unforgivable criminals to trade and traffic that precious human life. Trading and Trafficking Human life goes back a long way since the inception of human race. Together, lets value and create a world free from the horrors and traumas of human trafficking. Human traffickers rely on exploiting vulnerable individuals and the lack of public awareness to continue their abhorrent crimes. Let’s run for this noble cause.

*DIGITAL FREELANCING SCAM*
*JObSCAM*
*HOTEL / FLIGHT BOOKING SCAM*
*PART TIME WORK SCAM*
*CRYPTO SCAM*
*MANY MORE*

Few people r sending me some msg.  And asking if it’s scam as they r asking only for my bank account- they start like this and eventually make u tempted n asks for small amount 

*NEVER ENTER ANY*

Very happy to know that few people saved their money from THOSE CHEATING GANGS and hope more and more becomes aware , so I am going to post this msg continuously as many of our friends don’t scroll old msg - pls forward to all groups -

One tip in IT / part time job is the person gives you a task and asks u to deposit a small amount , don’t get into it

Some sends invite code for u to participate 

These are what I learnt from our friends 

———————
One of my friend working in lawyers office told me yesterday one indian came to their office saying he has lost *HKD2,000,000*

While discussing other person said someone lost *INR 30,00,000* by borrowing money by lodging his property 

One person from help group 1 said his friend lost *HKD600,000*

I am really confused how people can give money and fall in these scams

We have discussed this earlier but this needs more awakening, never pay money to get part time work and they pull you inside until you lose big money by tempting you

*NEVER SPARE A PENNY* to any stranger.
Don’t get excited , too many scams around on social media

Be aware of asking for your *CREDIT CARD*  one of my friend told me someone posing like a Marriott staff offered some nice packages and he stopped as she had all his details except his email ID, and luckily escaped from giving his credit card , even though they ask u for small, they will charge big amount. 

Hope we won’t hear anymore, we need to educate our friends/relatives.


Please spread this to ALL YOUR FRIENDS , HK, India , everywhere….

Thanks

[20/3/2023, 5:38:11 PM] ~ Kumar: That just means valid visas which are issued before that date but you're mentioning yours is expired in july 2020 already. So for eg: someone has 3 years or longer visa issued prior to 28th march 2020 than those are valid you can still clarify with the visa office by email to them.

*DIGITAL FREELANCING SCAM*
*JObSCAM*
*HOTEL / FLIGHT BOOKING SCAM*
*PART TIME WORK SCAM*
*CRYPTO SCAM*
*MANY MORE*

Few people r sending me some msg.  And asking if it’s scam as they r asking only for my bank account- they start like this and eventually make u tempted n asks for small amount 

*NEVER ENTER ANY*

Very happy to know that few people saved their money from THOSE CHEATING GANGS and hope more and more becomes aware , so I am going to post this msg continuously as many of our friends don’t scroll old msg - pls forward to all groups -

One tip in IT / part time job is the person gives you a task and asks u to deposit a small amount , don’t get into it

Some sends invite code for u to participate 

These are what I learnt from our friends 

———————
One of my friend working in lawyers office told me yesterday one indian came to their office saying he has lost *HKD2,000,000*

While discussing other person said someone lost *INR 30,00,000* by borrowing money by lodging his property 

One person from help group 1 said his friend lost *HKD600,000*

I am really confused how people can give money and fall in these scams

We have discussed this earlier but this needs more awakening, never pay money to get part time work and they pull you inside until you lose big money by tempting you

*NEVER SPARE A PENNY* to any stranger.
Don’t get excited , too many scams around on social media

Be aware of asking for your *CREDIT CARD*  one of my friend told me someone posing like a Marriott staff offered some nice packages and he stopped as she had all his details except his email ID, and luckily escaped from giving his credit card , even though they ask u for small, they will charge big amount. 

Hope we won’t hear anymore, we need to educate our friends/relatives.


Please spread this to ALL YOUR FRIENDS , HK, India , everywhere….

Thanks

[27/5/2023, 3:05:18 PM] ~ Raghav Rao: PLEASE *DO NOT GET TRAPPED*

YESTERDAY I HEARD ONE PERSON LOST100k HKD.  *DO NOT FALL FOR SHORTCUTS FOR MAKING QUICK MONEY, they will first give you and then trap you* 


*DIGITAL FREELANCING SCAM*
*JObSCAM*
*HOTEL / FLIGHT BOOKING SCAM*
*PART TIME WORK SCAM*
*CRYPTO SCAM*
*MANY MORE*

Few people r sending me some msg.  And asking if it’s scam as they r asking only for my bank account- they start like this and eventually make u tempted n asks for small amount 

*NEVER ENTER ANY*

Very happy to know that few people saved their money from THOSE CHEATING GANGS and hope more and more becomes aware , so I am going to post this msg continuously as many of our friends don’t scroll old msg - pls forward to all groups -

One tip in IT / part time job is the person gives you a task and asks u to deposit a small amount , don’t get into it

Some sends invite code for u to participate 

These are what I learnt from our friends 

———————
One of my friend working in lawyers office told me yesterday one indian came to their office saying he has lost *HKD2,000,000*

While discussing other person said someone lost *INR 30,00,000* by borrowing money by lodging his property 

One person from help group 1 said his friend lost *HKD600,000*

I am really confused how people can give money and fall in these scams

We have discussed this earlier but this needs more awakening, never pay money to get part time work and they pull you inside until you lose big money by tempting you

*NEVER SPARE A PENNY* to any stranger.
Don’t get excited , too many scams around on social media

Be aware of asking for your *CREDIT CARD*  one of my friend told me someone posing like a Marriott staff offered some nice packages and he stopped as she had all his details except his email ID, and luckily escaped from giving his credit card , even though they ask u for small, they will charge big amount. 

Hope we won’t hear anymore, we need to educate our friends/relatives.


Please spread this to ALL YOUR FRIENDS , HK, India , everywhere….

Thanks

Remember - it is overall Expensive.  

you need two things ASAP. HK passport so you can travel.

I want to book it for my mother who is coming to hk on dependent visa. As per rule any newcomer need to get hkid within one month of arriving but what to do in case no quotas are available
[28/7/2023, 7:56:17 AM] ~ sunny: How old mum
[28/7/2023, 7:56:56 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: She is 64
[28/7/2023, 7:59:44 AM] ~ sunny: Very simple way go wanchai immigration center morning 11 to 12 very easy you can get as many not going after book appointment and mum already 64 senior citizen so no problem as I send many last one month all got rest depend on your luck
[28/7/2023, 8:02:44 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: I don’t understand
[28/7/2023, 8:02:59 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: You mean we can get walk-in appointment ?
[28/7/2023, 8:03:38 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Between 11-12 at wan chai immigration ?
[28/7/2023, 8:06:49 AM] ~ Tuhina Sandhya Das: Just walk in and explain the situation to them. Immigration officers are quite helpful most of the time.
[28/7/2023, 8:07:59 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: So they give on the spot appointment ?
[28/7/2023, 8:09:11 AM] ~ Tuhina Sandhya Das: Yes. On a valid reason.
[28/7/2023, 8:09:22 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Ok thanks
[28/7/2023, 8:19:01 AM] ~ sunny: 29th july 3 to 4 pm available anyway do not worry they help you mum is 64 years old walk in ok
[28/7/2023, 9:02:06 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: They open on Saturday ?
[28/7/2023, 9:02:14 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: But I checked no booking available
[28/7/2023, 9:03:31 AM] ~ sunny: Yes open 845 to 1230
[28/7/2023, 9:04:25 AM] ~ sunny: But if no have booking better go Monday to Friday as normally Saturday full as everyone have holiday understand
[28/7/2023, 9:06:19 AM] ~ Siva: Another option is making an online booking for whichever date available and changing it online at night after 11 pm
[28/7/2023, 9:19:13 AM] ~ PJ: In that case they would not penalise for not being able to get a HkID because u cant book an appointment. My advice is to check quotas every night between 9pm-12am
[28/7/2023, 9:19:45 AM] ~ PJ: As per my knowledge, they don’t provide walk-in quotas regardless age
[28/7/2023, 9:56:36 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: No date available
[28/7/2023, 9:58:15 AM] ~ Siva: Night 11 pm onwards keep refreshing it comes a date in October or November I tried 2 weeks back for a friend
[28/7/2023, 9:58:45 AM] ~ Siva: Sometimes if lucky even next day can get not just wanchai any office in hk
[28/7/2023, 10:19:36 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: That’s uncertain. Means I have to sit every night and keep refreshing
[28/7/2023, 10:52:01 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: I went to immigration and they said they can not take walk in
[28/7/2023, 10:52:11 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Need to make online booking
[28/7/2023, 10:54:16 AM] ~ Siva: Unfortunately thats how it is right now. I did for my mom the same way couple of months back. Need 2 days clearly. One day for making a booking in future date after 11 pm. Next day around same time for change of appointment next day or a week later when spots open up. Need speed clicking the mouse otherwise it gets lost and again need to enter details again.
[28/7/2023, 11:37:12 AM] ~ मगन भाई 💪🏼👊: Try a different Centre if appoint is available there. I remember getting one in Fanling a few yrs ago when one close to my house was not available on a desired date.
[28/7/2023, 12:22:45 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: But they are not taking walk in anywhere it seems
[28/7/2023, 12:24:10 PM] ~ Siva: ‎This message was deleted.
[28/7/2023, 12:24:53 PM] ~ Siva: Yes walkin is no longer accepted in immigration nowadays for anybody. Its stricly by appointment via online booking either by internet or telephone booking system which also is full till October/November 2023. Suggest try for online appointment at any location in HK as just wanchai isnt easy to get
[28/7/2023, 12:25:11 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: Every location quota is full
[28/7/2023, 12:25:30 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: It was easier to get it some 2-3 years back
[28/7/2023, 12:25:34 PM] ~ Shashank Gangil: What happened now
[28/7/2023, 12:38:03 PM] ~ Siva: Only option is to try at night. Avoid trying on Fridays and Mondays. Middle of the week is best time to try for online appointments 11pm onwards can start from 9 pm to 11 pm if not more. My friend got for his mother like that only luckily next day. Due to many rush of applicants from Mainland and overseas and persons away from Hk for last 3 years they had to make it online also staff shortage

[26/8/2023, 9:28:37 AM] ~ Raghav Rao: *"Sil Suwandai - Hela Diviyayi" ~ Authentic Sri Lankan Cuisine Ceremony Offering to Lord Buddha, Monks and Devotees.*

Under the proposal and guidance of the Regional Food Promotion National Program of the President's Office, the Authentic Sri Lankan Cuisine Ceremony will be held on *Sunday, August 27, at the premises of "Ceylon Farm Village" in Sheung Shui,* affiliated to the Sri Lankan Buddhist Cultural Center in Hong Kong, according to the concept of "Sil Suwandai - Hela Diviyay ~ The Buddhist Way of Life”
Authentic Sri Lankan cuisine is a vibrant and diverse culinary tapestry that reflects the island nation's rich history, cultural influences, and unique geography.

The cuisine showcases an array of aromatic spices, tropical ingredients, and traditional cooking techniques passed down through generations.
Staple ingredients in Sri Lankan cooking are as diverse as the island nation's rich cultural heritage. Rice, a dietary staple, takes center stage in almost every meal, often accompanied by an array of aromatic curries. Coconut and its derivatives play a crucial role in Sri Lankan cuisine, with coconut milk and grated coconut lending their creamy texture to curries and desserts.
Spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and cumin infuse dishes with deep flavors while adding a distinct aroma.
These spices not only provide an explosion of taste but also offer various health benefits due to their natural medicinal properties. The artful use of spices reflects the mastery and creativity of Sri Lankan chefs who skillfully blend these ingredients to create tantalizing culinary experiences.

Farmers in Sri Lanka offer their first batch of produce to the village Buddhist temple and traditional households offer the first portion of their daily meal to Lord Buddha.

*We cordially invite you to experience this journey, offering and tasting the meals which created using Authentic Sri Lankan Ingredients, according to traditional recipes.*

Thanks for your support in keeping help group active and in order *after 8 years* , first help group was started on 3 June 2015, Thanks to ADMIN team.

As we can get more employers / can get more help , may I request each of you add *three friends /relatives* to *HELP GROUP* , (adults, living in HK).  They need not be Indians.

Most of the companies asks staff if they know anyone to refer and if our help group goes up from 5000 to 15000 members, we can get more employment opportunities and *who knows one day it will be of great help* to you or your spouse to find a job or it might help you to find staff , or some other help. 


Thanks

[1/9/2023, 6:20:33 PM] ~ Raghav Rao: Dear all,

*NEW RULE* in _order to streamline promotional activities_ 



From 9th September 2023 , Advertisements will be posted only twice a week -  on *Saturdays and Wednesdays* 

_*EXCEPTIONS*_


If any event based /time based advertisements, like a movie promotion, which *cannot wait until next posting day* *we will post IMMEDIATELY* as a special case (since we should not be biased towards other advertisers, min donation *will be HKD75* if you want to post on same day for an event /time based program that’s falling within next 3 days.

For example -  if you want to advertise on a Thursday  for a event that is falling on next day / same week Saturday /Sunday event, then we will post immediately. 

Other example- if you want to post on a Monday for a Tuesday (next day) event , we will post immediately , upon paying hkd75 to a registered charity 

This additional donation is just to accommodate urgent event , which can’t wait for regular advertising slots and we will not post normal promotional content immediately even if you pay hkd75.

Hope clear

Any doubts , pls call /pm admin in private 

Thanks

We would like to introduce HELP GROUP HK, an informal association of individuals within a WhatsApp community that has remained active for the past 8 years. Our primary objective is to foster a sense of unity and mutual assistance among more than 5000 Hong Kong Indians.

It is important to note that our community strictly *prohibits the exchange of personal monetary incentives*. Furthermore, we kindly request members to *refrain from sharing greetings, pleasantries, or forwarding unverified messages, videos, or other inappropriate content*.

Our platform has played a pivotal role in connecting individuals with job opportunities, with approximately 2000 individuals successfully securing employment through our HELP groups.

Additionally, we offer members the opportunity to promote their businesses or properties by making a charitable donation of HKD 50 to a *Hong Kong-registered charity*.

In closing, we firmly believe in the adage that *"One cannot help everyone, but everyone can help someone"* Thus, we encourage all members to actively engage in the spirit of mutual support and collaboration within our community.

Join us here:

Please note that when posting ads, you're essentially making a *donation to a charitable cause because* you want to promote your business. So, we ask you not to keep referring back to the cause your expense, as posting advertisements is entirely your decision.

Thank you,

[6/10/2023, 11:47:31 AM] ~ Shravs: HK is only 14 days on arrival subject to pre arrival registration approval.  If u apply for a visa with immigration dept, then u can get up to 90 days.
[6/10/2023, 11:51:28 AM] ~ Shashank Gangil: For 90 days need to apply online or via immi department. Some fee apply. 14 day is visa free on arrival
[6/10/2023, 12:19:18 PM] ~ HPN ॐ ࿘ ☬ ੴ ✡︎ ✟ ☸︎: For 90 days HK Visa you need a sponsor Friend Family or a company 
Immigration department will not grant 30 or 90 days visitor visa just like that
They will ask a lot of questions

[16/10/2023, 8:56:44 AM] ~ Raghav Rao: Hello Rao

Happy to share the Indian  helper employment contract renew process:

1. Get the ID 441, blue form from the HK immigration department - 4 of these.

2. Take BLS appointment for form filling (in case of doubts) and submission back to back.

3. Once form is fully filled, sign by both helper & employer & submit it at BLS for attestation by Indian consulate - takes 3-5 working days

4. Once you receive the form - 3 copies as Indian consulate will keep 1 for its record, make sure it’s attested fully. In next step can submit to HK immigration  for online renewal - 
https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/fdh/smartrenewal.html

The above website will first ask details of helper name, age, DOB, nationality etc. (upload below scanned document HKID, existing visa pages, passport front, back & last travel stamp if any) plus the scan copy of new employment form. You can apply for extension of stay which means after 1 year of the next contract your helper will need to travel outside to home or in some cases if agreed between employer & helper the visa can be extended again without travel, to activate the remaining 1 year of the visa. -The online form other parts are employer details on HKID, passport (if on working visa), address proof through utility bills - not older than 3 months, Financial proof - Bank statement or payslips - best to give 3 months record. 
5. The HK immigration step for approval takes 10-15 business days, however in 2-3 business days you should receive acknowledgment of submitting application.

6. HK immigration might contact directly on phone or email in case any further docs are needed. Once the processing completes you can download the evisa by paying online.
[16/10/2023, 8:56:46 AM] ~ Raghav Rao: Total fees with above process is:

BLS charge approx: 300-500 HKD
VISA fees: 230 HKD

PS: above case have not bought tickets yet as it’s an year extension with helper to travel after 1 year to activate next half of the visa.

I am a professional software engineer who has worked in the Semiconductor industry as a software engineer for developing automation software for outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) providers, device manufacturers, foundries and IC substrate manufacturers for a wide range of packaging applications.

I am firm in C++, C++11, C++17 and C++20, C#, Python and other programming languages. 

I am very specialised in Boost libraries, Object Oriented programming concepts, Design Patterns, Refactoring of the code, Object Oriented principles, UML design and Project management.

Recently, I found that I am excellent at mentoring my colleagues in programming and design, and my colleagues and my managers very much appreciated it. To help students with difficulty understanding the software concepts, principles, programming, OOPs and UML, I am ready to mentor your children in coping with modern programming languages. 

If you are interested in learning computer programming language and techniques, please WhatsApp me +852 9018 1605.

Also pls advise if Immigration Department can provide HKID on urgent basis. I AM SMART is not registered on my mobile.
[30/10/2023, 11:05:58 PM] ~ RR: As per my understanding for travelling you need passport and visa. You should get in touch with immigration department and explain your situation. And you should apply for HKID and keep the application receipt. Probably when you are back to HK, you can show the receipt to the immigration officer if its asked for. Worst case postpone your travel. We can give some information but we dont represent immigration and better to get in touch with them soon. India immigration side, till my HKID was not permanent, they always used to check my work VISA.

No idea about urgent issuance of HKID by immigration department.

May be others can share their insights.

In either case get in touch with immigration department where you will get first hand information. HK Govt people are very helpful most of the time.
[30/10/2023, 11:08:42 PM] ~ Sumit Gupta: Thanks
[30/10/2023, 11:08:48 PM] ~ RR: You should also inform/check with police. Someone may have handed over to police. I have never gone to police, so not sure on formality.
[30/10/2023, 11:09:37 PM] ~ Sumit Gupta: Thanks, filed ereport
[30/10/2023, 11:10:42 PM] ~ Yash: Nothing to do with your hkid … just use your passport with visa at immigration and go through this link for more information.. no need to postpone
[30/10/2023, 11:10:44 PM] ~ Yash: https://www.gov.hk/en/residents/immigration/tips/loseid.htm
[30/10/2023, 11:12:56 PM] ~ Anu: File a police report and then just walk in to the immigration for hk id application … they will give you temporary id
[30/10/2023, 11:13:21 PM] ~ Anu: I did the same as I have to travel too … if you go early around 8 there is no queue and they let you do walk in for lost hk id case
[31/10/2023, 12:05:48 AM] ~ STAY POSITIVE IN LIFE: yes u can travel outside hongkong, 

Just make sure you have reported your *LOST ID* to nearest police station on the day you lost and you will be issued a police report..day you lost.

but you need to come back before your employment visa gets expired at least 8-10 days before to be on safe side  carry police report  and explain at departure point to immigration and show them Police Report copy and when coming back you produce again same police report.

hopefully your passport has been endorsed with Immigration chop of your validity stay ‎<This message was edited>
