Good morning.

⛔️   Yesterday I received a call from a Delhi number +91 11-26112345 and the caller identified himself as calling on behalf of Indian Emigration Department at New Delhi. 

He asked about verification of immigration matters. 
He will talk very professionally and finally asked to 12000 HKD through some money exchange for clearing the formalities 
it shows as google number for consulate.

It seems this is a scam. Be careful

The second phase of the Consumption Voucher Scheme will be issued on August 7. A reader of Sing Tao Daily, surnamed Wong, complained that she was told by the government she doesn’t have the eligibility to receive the vouchers.

As Wong sought to immigrate in 2011, she has withdrawn the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF). She flew back the next year and works in Hong Kong for the last ten years. She keeps paying the taxes as well as contributing to a new MPF. 

Wong is angry and annoyed after an official SMS telling her she is ineligible for the Consumption Voucher.

The government stated that if citizens have permanently left Hong Kong or are intending to leave Hong Kong, they will lose their eligibility for the consumption voucher. A spokesperson added that some may lose their eligibility if they applied to withdraw their MPF early due to permanent departure from the city.

 *MAJOR CHANGES TO REAL ESTATE AND BUSINESS ADVERTISING* 

Effective from 1st September 2022, all business and real estate advertisers must make a *minimum deposit of HKD50 to a CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION registered UNDER section 88, Inland Revenue Department Cap. 112* in order to post their advertisement in the Help Group.

Please note that *NO money should be transferred to any of the admins* nor do the admins gain any financial incentive from this plan of action.  This step is just in line with the long-term endeavor of the Help Group to continually extend helping hands to people in need. 

Posting details: 

•	All forms of advertising (Rent /Sell residential /commercial property or promote your products/service / any commercial activity and second hand sales) can be done ONLY upon making a charitable donation of HKD50 (minimum value per donation). It cannot be posted directly by you /others except ADMINS.

•	Only one photo with or without a short message containing contact information is allowed. No videos, pdfs, documents allowed. 

•	Minimum HKD50 to be paid to the charitable organization for each advertisement (ONETIME PAYMENT = ONETIME ADVERTISEMENT PERMITTED).

•	One-time donations made of a larger value (greater than HKD50) cannot be used for multiple advertisement postings. The admins do not have the scope to keep a record of the pending amount in the donations made with the number of advertisements posted. (ONETIME PAYMENT of HKD50 or more = ONETIME ADVERTISEMENT PERMITTED).

•	From 1st September 2022, no more Fridays and once in a month advertisement issue as sometimes few misses the day. Advertisements can be posted on any day of the month depending on the charitable donation made. 

•	For all remittances made, if possible,kindly mention “HELP GROUP” so that the charitable organization is aware of the source. 

•	Following registered charitable organizations run by Indians are recommended (alphabetical order), but you are free to contribute to any REGISTERED CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION

 *MAJOR CHANGES TO REAL ESTATE AND BUSINESS ADVERTISING* 

Effective from 1st September 2022, all business and real estate advertisers must make a *minimum deposit of HKD50 to a CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION registered UNDER section 88, Inland Revenue Department Cap. 112* in order to post their advertisement in the Help Group.

Please note that *NO money should be transferred to any of the admins* nor do the admins gain any financial incentive from this plan of action.  This step is just in line with the long-term endeavor of the Help Group to continually extend helping hands to people in need. 

Posting details: 

•	All forms of advertising (Rent /Sell residential /commercial property or promote your products/service / any commercial activity and second hand sales) can be done ONLY upon making a charitable donation of HKD50 (minimum value per donation). It cannot be posted directly by you /others except ADMINS.

•	Only one photo with or without a short message containing contact information is allowed. No videos, pdfs, documents allowed. 

•	Minimum HKD50 to be paid to the charitable organization for each advertisement (ONETIME PAYMENT = ONETIME ADVERTISEMENT PERMITTED).

•	One-time donations made of a larger value (greater than HKD50) cannot be used for multiple advertisement postings. The admins do not have the scope to keep a record of the pending amount in the donations made with the number of advertisements posted. (ONETIME PAYMENT of HKD50 or more = ONETIME ADVERTISEMENT PERMITTED).

•	From 1st September 2022, no more Fridays and once in a month advertisement issue as sometimes few misses the day. Advertisements can be posted on any day of the month depending on the charitable donation made.

[23/9/2022, 9:44:02 PM] ‪+852 5291 1501‬: John Lee Press Conference on Cancellation of Hotel Quarantine: 

Last updated at 1620 on 9/23: 


Mr. John Lee: 

New Measures Introduced by Hong Kong Government. 

1) All arrivals at HKIA Quarantine measures will be changed to 0+3 effective Monday, Sep 26 at 0600hrs. 

2) Pre-Flight PCR will be scrapped. This has been replaced by a RAT test to be taken within 24-hours of flight departure time. There is a need for a Day 2, Day 4 and Day 6 PCR test. 

3) Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated Hong Kong Residents can return. 

4) No quota on return to Hong Kong Scheme 

------------------------------------------

0+3 Scheme: 

• Quarantine hotels will be scrapped. 

• People can return directly home or go to any hotel of his/her choice to undergo 3 day medical surveillance.

• There will be a PCR test at the airport and there is no need to wait for the result. Test and Go arrangement. 

• All passengers can use any form of public transport

• After the airport test is negative an amber code will be sent to the handphone of the passenger. 

• On day 3 after a negative PCR test a blue code will be sent to the passenger. 

• A daily rat test must be taken for the first 7 days too. 

• If positive you can quarantine at your hotel or home. If you home is not suitable, you can still choose to ask the Hong Kong Government to invite you to one of their quarantine facilities. 

------------------------------------------

Pre-Flight PCR will be scrapped:

• RAT test must be taken within 24 hours of departure time. 

• Sounds like it needs to the test needs to be uploaded to HKGOV prior to boarding. 

------------------------------------------

Unvaccinated Hong Kong Residents can return: 

• Unvaccinated or those who have not completed their vaccinations can board a plane to Hong Kong. 

• After they have landed in Hong Kong no special exemptions will be made. They will have to follow the current Hong Kong laws to get a vaccine pass like everyone else. 

The Hong Kong Government will not lie flat and they will continue to control the number of cases in the community. The Government plans to protect the elderly, children and the vulnerable. 

Hong Kong should be optimistic about controlling the epidemic. 

------------------------------------------

Professor Lo Chung-Mau: 

• Prof Lo has data that can show you why 0+3 will not increase risk compared to 0+0. 

• The one reason for 0+3 and the PCR tests is because The Hong Kong Government does not want new variants to enter the community.

• Hong Kong is following a science based approach 

• He thanks all those involved including the general public in taking vaccinations this year. The number of those fully vaccinated persons have greatly increased compared to earlier this year. 

• The young and old need extra protection. 

• The R value is currently less than 1 and community testing centers are seeing a downward trend. 

• Professor Lo believes the Omicron Ba. 5 spread is under control

• Starting 8/22 (3+4 Introduction Date) visitor numbers have increased. 

• About 3.3% of inbound visitors are positive compared to the earlier 4.7%

• Global figures are falling. 

• Law enforcement have not found any amber code persons trying to enter restricted premises. 

------------------------------------------

Mr. John Lee: 

• He wants to control the overall epidemic situation in an orderly way. 

• The Government will monitor the situation closely, so all the risks are controlled and things can progress in an orderly manner. 

• If there are positive developments as we progress, there will be more room for more activities to open up. 

• Visitors will come as we are a free economy, a place of opportunities, a place of east meets west, a place of success stories and a place where you can use HK to open a base to The Mainland. 

• After the 3rd day you can do everything a Hong Kong Citizen does including eat and drink out.

•	Minimum HKD50 to be paid to the charitable organization for each advertisement (ONETIME PAYMENT = ONETIME ADVERTISEMENT PERMITTED).

The admins do not have the scope to keep a record of the pending amount in the donations made with the number of advertisements posted. (ONETIME PAYMENT of HKD50 or more = ONETIME ADVERTISEMENT PERMITTED).

[7/10/2022, 11:46:13 AM] ‪+852 5291 1501‬: John Lee Press Conference on Cancellation of Hotel Quarantine: 

Last updated at 1620 on 9/23: 


Mr. John Lee: 

New Measures Introduced by Hong Kong Government. 

1) All arrivals at HKIA Quarantine measures will be changed to 0+3 effective Monday, Sep 26 at 0600hrs. 

2) Pre-Flight PCR will be scrapped. This has been replaced by a RAT test to be taken within 24-hours of flight departure time. There is a need for a Day 2, Day 4 and Day 6 PCR test. 

3) Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated Hong Kong Residents can return. 

4) No quota on return to Hong Kong Scheme 

------------------------------------------

0+3 Scheme: 

• Quarantine hotels will be scrapped. 

• People can return directly home or go to any hotel of his/her choice to undergo 3 day medical surveillance.

• There will be a PCR test at the airport and there is no need to wait for the result. Test and Go arrangement. 

• All passengers can use any form of public transport

• After the airport test is negative an amber code will be sent to the handphone of the passenger. 

• On day 3 after a negative PCR test a blue code will be sent to the passenger. 

• A daily rat test must be taken for the first 7 days too. 

• If positive you can quarantine at your hotel or home. If you home is not suitable, you can still choose to ask the Hong Kong Government to invite you to one of their quarantine facilities. 

------------------------------------------

Pre-Flight PCR will be scrapped:

• RAT test must be taken within 24 hours of departure time. 

• Sounds like it needs to the test needs to be uploaded to HKGOV prior to boarding. 

------------------------------------------

Unvaccinated Hong Kong Residents can return: 

• Unvaccinated or those who have not completed their vaccinations can board a plane to Hong Kong. 

• After they have landed in Hong Kong no special exemptions will be made. They will have to follow the current Hong Kong laws to get a vaccine pass like everyone else. 

The Hong Kong Government will not lie flat and they will continue to control the number of cases in the community. The Government plans to protect the elderly, children and the vulnerable. 

Hong Kong should be optimistic about controlling the epidemic. 

------------------------------------------

Professor Lo Chung-Mau: 

• Prof Lo has data that can show you why 0+3 will not increase risk compared to 0+0. 

• The one reason for 0+3 and the PCR tests is because The Hong Kong Government does not want new variants to enter the community.

• Hong Kong is following a science based approach 

• He thanks all those involved including the general public in taking vaccinations this year. The number of those fully vaccinated persons have greatly increased compared to earlier this year. 

• The young and old need extra protection. 

• The R value is currently less than 1 and community testing centers are seeing a downward trend. 

• Professor Lo believes the Omicron Ba. 5 spread is under control

• Starting 8/22 (3+4 Introduction Date) visitor numbers have increased. 

• About 3.3% of inbound visitors are positive compared to the earlier 4.7%

• Global figures are falling. 

• Law enforcement have not found any amber code persons trying to enter restricted premises. 

------------------------------------------

Mr. John Lee: 

• He wants to control the overall epidemic situation in an orderly way. 

• The Government will monitor the situation closely, so all the risks are controlled and things can progress in an orderly manner. 

• If there are positive developments as we progress, there will be more room for more activities to open up. 

• Visitors will come as we are a free economy, a place of opportunities, a place of east meets west, a place of success stories and a place where you can use HK to open a base to The Mainland. 

• After the 3rd day you can do everything a Hong Kong Citizen does including eat and drink out.

[12/10/2022, 4:48:59 PM] ‪+91 98192 80503‬: hi - I have a specific query which Immigration dept didnt give me a proper reply about despite emailing twice. 
if anyone has knowledge about this, can you please guide me.

I have resigned from my old job in HK and will be starting a new one in 3months. In the interim, I have returned to India. 
now after resignation, my right to work stands revoked, but I still have right of abode. Does this mean I can travel to HK until I have a valid right of abode even before starting my new job/obtaining new employment visa with new employer?
[12/10/2022, 4:49:31 PM] ‪+91 98192 80503‬: Re-entry into the HKSAR

Non-permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), irrespective of their nationality and type of travel document held, do not require a re-entry visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR provided that they return within the currency of their permitted limit of stay and that the circumstances upon which they have acquired their residential status remain unchanged.

above is from immd website

[12/10/2022, 5:03:15 PM] ‪+852 5627 2701‬: From my understanding, if your employment visa is sponsored by your employer, and you leave the employer, the visa sponsored by them stands cancelled. You have 1 month to find a new sponsor or leave. I guess in your case, you need new visa sponsored by your new company to come back again.
[12/10/2022, 5:04:45 PM] ‪+91 98192 80503‬: no, that much im clear about and have confirmed with immd, that I have a right of abode until the end of expiry of employment visa. 
when i leave my employer, only my right to work ceases, not my right of abode.
[12/10/2022, 5:07:01 PM] ‪+852 5627 2701‬: But right to abode is only for permanent residents
[12/10/2022, 5:07:10 PM] ‪+91 98192 80503‬: no
[12/10/2022, 5:08:51 PM] ‪+852 5627 2701‬: It is as per immigration website.
[12/10/2022, 5:09:54 PM] ‪+852 5627 2701‬: https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/roa/eligible.html
[12/10/2022, 5:10:30 PM] ‪+852 5627 2701‬: You need to be ordinary resident of hk for continuous 7 years to get this status
[12/10/2022, 5:10:37 PM] ‪+91 98192 80503‬: I have an email from my old employer and immd confirming I have right of abode until expiry of my old employment visa. 
this is not something im worried about.
[12/10/2022, 5:10:51 PM] ‪+852 5627 2701‬: Ok
[12/10/2022, 5:13:43 PM] ‪+852 5627 2701‬: If immd has confirmed that you have right of abode that means you can enter hk anytime till ur current visa is valid
[12/10/2022, 5:16:41 PM] ‪+91 98192 80503‬: "that means you can enter hk anytime till ur current visa is valid" <-- this is the part i'm trying to understand because neither their website nor their email confirms anything to this effect
[12/10/2022, 5:17:06 PM] ‪+852 5627 2701‬: Right of abode means entering Hong Kong without restriction
